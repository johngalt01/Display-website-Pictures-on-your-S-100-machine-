<center><b><font color="lime">THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY...</font></b></center>
<p>...is of little use to you? Do you long for the days of your youth when 
computers were new, and exciting (and perhaps useful only to those with 
the "know how"?) Or maybe the early days of computers were before you were 
even born, and you simply want to know what the big deal was? Or maybe you're 
like me, a mere child when you first heard the notion that people could actually 
have a computer in their very own home!</p>

<p>Those were exciting times. Computer technology moved fast and chaotically. 
The standard of the day may not have been recognized a few months later. Some 
ideas persisted (and persist today): the hard drive, serial ports, video monitors. 
Some ideas were cast aside: the stringy floppy, paper tape, and the IBM PCjr. 
But one thing is for sure, we were literally inventing the future.</p>

<p>My goal is to keep the excitement alive. As a kid, I loved building electronic kits. 
I loved reading about computers. My two loves finally came together in 1981 when 
I built a Sinclair ZX81 - yes it was a relatively simple kit, but it impressed 
the heck out of everyone when I showed them the computer <i>that I built!</i></p>

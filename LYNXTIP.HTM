The LYNX Cheats file was originally created and maintained by Damian Gick.
He unfortunately lost his net access and couldn't continue his support. 
The honour of maintaining the LYNX Cheats file was then passed on to Kevin 
(Tazzzzz) Dangoor, who provided exemplary service to the LYNX community by 
not only maintaining the Cheats file but also compiling all of Robert Jung's 
game reviews into one handy file. As an added service he made these files 
available through a highly efficient mail server. Kevin sold his Lynx and 
has passed on the torch of maintaining both the Reviews and Cheat files to 
yours truly. I have some big shoes to fill, and I will do my best to carry 
on the tradition set forth by my predecessors.

The LYNX cheat file is now more comprehensive than ever before. I have added
several more tips and tricks as well as changing the format slightly. I hope
that you will find the changes refreshing and I look forward to any comments 
or suggestions that you may have about them. Incidentally, the LYNX Cheat file 
is also available in RTF format (which includes bitmapped maps). If you would
like to submit any tips or tricks that you have come across or discovered,
please e-mail them to the address listed below.   

The FAQ, the Lynx Game Reviews, and the Lynx Cheat files now reside at the 
anonymous ftp site: ftp.mantis.co.uk in /pub/uploads. Special thanks should be 
extended to Mathew for maintaining the ftp site and mail server.

[APB]=====================================================================
				  A.P.B.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Level skip:

     In APB, if you hold down OPT 1 and OPT 2, and run into a donut (or 
through the Donut shop) your quota will be filled and you will be returned 
to the station and proceed to the next level.


Skip to level 99:

     When your quota is met, hold down OPT 1 and OPT 2 when you touch the
Officer Bob parking space. This will warp you to level 99. (The game will
not end, just repeat level 99 with random quotas).

Double Fuel:  

     On Highway 12 you will find gas pumps right next to each other.  Park
directly in the middle of the two pumps and the gas pumps twice as fast. 

[AWE]=====================================================================
			       AWESOME GOLF
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hole in one:

     Entering LANDLORD as your name at the beginning of the game. Use the 
OPTION 2 button to swing at the ball. Hitting OPTION 2 while the ball is 
in the air, will sink the ball!

[BAK]=====================================================================
				BASKETBRAWL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Play with Michel Jordan on your team!

     Put in MJ?? to play with a partner, supposedly Jordan. Replace the ??
with any two numbers. Pause, hold down Option 1 and press Option 2. You can
change the pause message to anything you want! (from Star*Lynx BBS)

[BAT]=====================================================================
			      BATMAN RETURNS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Invincibilitiy:

You can make Batman invincible with the following steps at the title screen 
(the one with the Batlogo): press up 8 times, down 12 times, left 15 times, 
right 19 times and option 1 27 times, press A or B to start the game. Once 
the action starts, press pause. Then use option 1 to skip to the next level, 
option 2 to make Batman invincible! Falling can still kill you, however.
(From Video Games and Computer Entertainment)

Increased life and Batarangs:  

When you come to a large red box with a bow on level one, stand on top and 
move to the right edge of it.  Motorcycles will bust out of the box on the 
right hand side.  Once this happens, jump down and walk inside the box.  At 
this point, you will receive ten more Batarangs and you life line will 
increase.       (Electronic Gaming Monthly)

Tactics for the first level:

1. Most IMPORTANT is keep moving. Don't sit still in one place or you will be
pounded. DO NOT use your baterangs or acid vials in the first stage when you
fight the clowns, goons, machine gun weirdos, etc.  They can be destroyed
by either jumping over them (which I do) and/or punching them. THIS is most
important. When you reach the duck, you should have 70 batarangs and I think
13 acid vials.
 
2. To defeat the duck, stand on the top ledge and TIME your shots. This is
most important. Do NOT jump off or down the ledge you are on otherwise
the penguins bombs wil hit you and take off a lot of life. The most important
thing to defeat the duck is watching the ducks pattern and timing your shots.
When I defeat the duck, I usually have 30-35 batarangs left. You do not need 
to use you acid vials.

3. After you defeat the duck, walk to the right and get your life vial.

4. side note:  You have a much better punching range when you duck down
and punch.

Tactics for the second level:

The idea here is to keep moving , but be very cautious. Your worst enemy is 
the shotgun cops. Because their bullets will make you fall to your death
if the bullets hit you while jumping. 

1. Grab all power ups ( you will need all of them espec. the batarnags and 
life)

2. Wen you are about to jump from a ledge, fire  a batarang to the right. 
If you hear someone dying, fire another. This will stop the shotgun cops 
from blowing you out of the air. Note that this must be done quickly. If 
you stand in one place to long, another shot gun cop will come from behind 
you. Don't worry about the normal police shooting you. Their bullets don't 
take off much.

3. Don't shoot like a wild man. DONT shoot at every goon either. Shoot the
shotgun cops. You can punch or jump obver the rest. However, if you are 
about to jump off a ledge, then shoot the bad guys to the left or right of 
you.

4. Beware the yellow crates on the ground for they explode. WHat you do is 
jump on one and then jump to safety. In aboout 2 seconds it will explode.

5. When you fight catwoman, you will need at least 30 batarangs and 10 vials. 
Again timing is important. What you should do is jump a lot as this will not 
let her whip hit you. All the way to the right, you will find a life power 
up. Get it if you are low in health.

Tactics for the fourth level:  

1. Your first order of business should be to avoid the penguin and head for 
the power generator at the end of the stage. You must duck and punch the 
little box on the ground (the one with the lightning bolt on it) until the 
generator blows up; this will stop the cage from lowering the Ice Princess 
into the murky depths.

2. The Penguin will slide and attack you while you're doing this, but you
should shrug him off by jumping over him and hitting him with a Batarang
or acid vial to send him momentarily into the pool.  The Penguin will not
die until you've destroyed the power generator, so don't waste too much
time attacking him at first.  Once the generator explodes, send him a few
well-placed acid vials or Batarangs and you'll advance to the game's 
disappointing ending sequence.          (Video Games magazine)

[BAL]=====================================================================
			       BATTLEWHEELS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Get the Spray Gun While on Foot:

When you're on foot, pressing OPTION-2 + OPTION-1 will get you a paint
sprayer.


Lock Your Viewscreen:

When you are looking at an alternate view (left, back, or right, by using 
the B button), press and hold OPTION 2 before releasing button B. When you 
release button B, your view will be "locked" in that direction until you 
press button B again.


Stealth Mode:

On the character selection/options screen, pick the female driver with 
the short blonde hair. Now pick the green car, and keep the highlight 
box around the car. Hold OPTION 1 and press button A, and your car turns
to an all-black design. When you play, your car will be invisible on 
radar and "by eye". You will be seen if you leave your car, and finding 
it again can be tricky...


Super Car!

On the character selection/options screen, pick the male blonde driver. 
Now pick the tan car, and keep the highlight box around the car. Hold 
OPTION 1 and press button A, and your car turns to a red body with a 
black top. When you play, your car will have unlimited ammunition and 
rapid-fire for all weapons.


[BIL]=====================================================================
		    BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

	 WalkThru From Portable Addiction Electronic Magazine

     First of all, collect all the notes you can get and find the gold
nugget. Now go to the guarded building and give the nugget to the guard.
Enter and find the man that tells you about the staff. Return to the
telephone booth and travel to 15OO BC. Use the scare stone. Find all the
notes you can get  (remember to count by sixteens!).  Enter the valley and
find the paper note about the fake staff. Travel back in time and put the
note at the pillar. Go to the South-East of Egypt and find the royal ankh
(You must wade through shallow water).  Travel to 15OO again and find the
boat at the South-West part of Egypt. Use the royal ankh.  Find your way
thru the water (it's like an invisible maze). First go to the place where
you found the ankh in 17OO BC. Enter the temple and find the  secret
passage which leads to the harp. Return to your boat and go to the pyramid.
Go into the pyramid and open the door by walking over the red spots on the
ground. Then, when past the wall/door, walk over the four other red spots
and take the staff. Find the two keys and open the corresponding doors. To
get rid of the two creatures guarding the room,  just lure them out of
there and then run away. When you return to the room they will  be gone. To
take the staff, use the harp.  Return the staff  to the man to get the
flute. Use this flute in 17OO BC at the North-East to scare the  animals
over there.  Then find all the notes that are hidden under the trees to
find a phonebook-page.  Travel to Rome.

     First, enter the dungeon.  Find all the notes and the two keys:  Blue
and black.  Remember to visit Caesar at the north of the arena when you
have enough notes.  Outside the arena you must once again find notes. When
you think you have all of them, go to the statue. Push the four pieces
around the statue in place and the push the statue.   Now do this again and
then go stand in the middle yourself.  After you get launched, find all the
notes around the house, but don't enter it.  When you got all  the notes,
walk into a roman to get kicked out of the garden. You are now outside. Go
West, to where a roman is guarding the entrance of the city. Now go down
and find your way through the forest.  Somewhere in the forest there is the
next page of the phonebook.  You must collect all the notes in the forest
and you must also find the little building.  Enter it and find the way
through the maze until you find an apple.  Leave the building and  go to
the guard.  Give him the apple and enter the city. If everything is right
you now have 8O notes.  Travel to Europe.

     In Europe, enter the mansion.  To avoid the furniture,  stay on the
green dots on the floor.  This may take some practise!   Find the white key
and then find your way to the backyard.  Use the black key to  open the
gate. Go to the North-West of the screen to find a red key. Use it to enter
the small house nearby.  Avoid dracula  and take  the magic wand  next to
his coffin.  Return to the mansion and find the organ. Use the wand to
shrink it down so you can carry it.  Return to the phonebooth   (The wand
causes the furniture to stop).   Travel back  to Rome.   Do the  trick
with the statue and this time enter the house while using the organ pipes.
You can now safely walk thru the house to the backyard to take the lyre.
Return  the lyre to Ceasar and  you will get another lyre.  Enter the
dungeon and use the lyre to scare away the lion that guards the white lock.
Use the white key to open the lock and take the page of the phonebook.

     Travel to Rome 7O BC and enter the dungeon.  Use the black key and put
it back where you found it  (Bottom-right). Now travel to Texas. Collect
all the notes you can get.   Somewhere,  hidden under a skull,  there's a
golden coin.  Go to the station and buy a ticket. Walk to the train and use
the ticket.  Now use the train to find the remaining notes. You must also
find the golden nugget, hidden under yet another skull.  Travel back to
Egypt and replace the golden nugget at the place where you first found it.
Now travel to San Dimas 2691 AD!  Yeah, most radical, dude!

     Be careful on the step-stones as you can only jump from one to another
if they are in the middle-position.  Again find as many notes as you can
and find the dynamite. Return to Texas. Use the dynamite to  release Billy
the Kid. Return to San Dimas. Go to the  place where you  usually get
overwhelmed by enemies and use the harmonica. You can now safely enter  the
next part of San Dimas.  Every time you pick up a note in  this part, a
block will disappear somewhere else, thus letting you reach other notes
after which you will be rewarded with a golden key.  Return to Europe.

     Collect 16 notes. Use the golden key to enter the previously
unaccessable house at the swamp.  Here you will find a mandolin.   You can
use this to enter the previously locked part of San Dimas. The Grim Reaper
welcomes you, and you're now ready to play his game. As the exact route
isn't easy  to explain in a solution like this,  I'll just tell you what to
do. The objective of this part is to collect yet another 16 notes.
Sometimes it is necessary to shove blocks over the  lava in such a way that
you can go  to other parts of  the playing field.   The princesses have got
the last note.  If you succeed in rescuing them you should have 144 notes
by that time.  To get back to the entrance of the playing field, go east
from the place where your rescued the babes.  The go south and walk
clockwise (ie: south, west, north).  When you are standing against the
north wall,  walk west to the corner and go counter-clockwise. Once in the
northeast corner you must go west, south, west and north to the exit.
You'll have to find the correct tiles to jump on all the way yourself. Now
you must return to the phone booth.  The Grim Reaper is guarding it,  but
when you play your guitar he suddenly realizes that he has LOST!  Enter the
booth and travel through time to finish the game!

[BLU]=====================================================================

The mission codes are:

	   Code     Mission No.        Code      Mission No.
    
	   AAAA         1              LOCK          6

	   NINE         5


Landing upside-down:

How About an Upside-Down Landing?  In Level 6, you land and take-off from 
air strips.  Try doing a barrel-roll (Pressing Option 2 and turn left or 
right), and then hold the plane upside-down, while pressing Up over and 
airstrip (to land).  You will then land upside-down, the cockpit opens 
from the fuel tank, and you take off backwards!


Bonus points:

For bonus points, hit your afterburniners as you enter the canyons on level
BELL. The Gutsy Bonus will give you 30,000 points ("You've got guts!").
When you're in the canyons fire your afterburners for 65,000 poins (Lunatic
Bonus) "You're crazy!!" The points are added when you land -- but if you do
both, it will only display the Lunatic Bonus, but you get points for both.
(A good place for the second bonus is right before you enter the second set
of canyons)


[CAL]=====================================================================
			     CALIFORNIA GAMES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although the manual says it's two player, up to 4 can be Comlynxed. It may
take a few tries, but keep at it. (It's also a bit slow, but hey, it wasn't
meant for 4 players.. :)

BMX: If you stay just a little (about one pixel) above the place where the
grass meets the dirt there won't be anything in your way (Like those pesky
bales of hay). You can crash the game by hitting the bale of hay on the
bottom of the track just before the finish line. The game will freeze and
the only thing you can do it turn it off. Tiny tid-bit: If you're going
_really_ fast when you cross the finish line and jump just a little after
crossing it, you will end up crashing into something you can't see way to
the right.

SURFING: In the surfing game, you can ride the pelican. Run your last man
into the bottom of the screen a few seconds before the timer runs out. The
bird will fly across the screen until the timer runs out and you'll land on
it! It's possible to do an UNREAL 360 (5 360's) for 1200 points (As opposed
to 600 for a Quadruple 360)

FOOTBAG:  If you spin right after jumping, you spin faster than normal.
Thus, jump and hit the bag with your head, then spin away...
Also-- in the manual under Foot Bag it says: "Score an extra 50 points for
hitting the seagull in the beak with the foot bag (but only in this game --
be kind to the birdies in the other events)."
[ Thought that was pretty cute. :)  d.g. ]

HALF-PIPE: Hitting Option 2 while skating will show off the Lynx's awesome
scaling capabilities.

			CHIP'S CHALLENGE
		    FRACTAL GENERATOR PROGRAM
			   INSTRUCTIONS

Chip's Challenge has a secret. In it's many codes for levels of 
play, there is a code which will allow you to enter into the 
infinite world of fractals. A fractal is a geometrical or physical 
structure that has an irregular or fragmented shape at all scales 
of measurement between a greatest and a smallest scale such that 
certain mathematical or physical properties of the structure are 
greater than the spatial dimensions. If you can understand the 
definition, that's what a fractal is.

Fractals were discovered by a man named Benoit Mandlebrot and he 
even named one of the images you'll see in this program after 
himself. There are lots of different images to be seen in this 
program, so don't just stay in one area. Now, on with the fun of 
fractals.

The code for entering the program is MAND. After it is entered. a 
picture will start to form on the screen. DON'T TOUCH ANY BUTTONS 
UNTIL THE PICTURE IS DONE. When it's done, then you can move 
around and zoom in to see more details. NOTE: Since each picture 
has extremely fine detail, it will usually take a few minutes for 
an image to form. Especially if there is black in ore around the 
picture.

CONTROLS FOR THE PROGRAM:

(B) Button: When this button is pushed, it will create a box 
	    outline on the screen which you can move around. When 
	    the button is pushed again, the image on the screen 
	    will zoom away from you.

(A) Button: When this button is pressed, it will also create a box 
	    outline. When pressed again, this will cause the image 
	    to zoom towards you.

NOTE: After the image has either been zoomed away or towards you, 
take the outline off the screen and let the Lynx adjust the 
picture to more detail.

OPTION 1 Button: This will create and vanish he box outline.       
		 NOTE: Always take the outline off the screen 
		 after you are done with it.

OPTION 2 Button: This will create the box outline and starts the 
		 color cycling on the screen. One push on the 
		 button causes the cycling to go forward. Another 
		 push causes it to go backwards and a third will 
		 stop the cycling altogether. NOTE: To change the 
		 color of the cycling, go to the index.

PAUSE Button: This button will cause the MANDLEBROT / JULIA SET 
	      EXPLORER INDEX to appear on the screen. In the 
	      index, you can change the depth, color and cycle 
	      rate of the fractal's and also create your own 
	      pictures. The index should look like this:

		       MANDLEBROT EXPLORER

		       X:    FE.0000000000
		       Y:    FE.0000000000
		       STEP: 00.0800000000
		       DEPTH:         0100
		       PALETTE:         00
		       CYCLE RATE:      04
		       XJUL: 00.0000000000
		       YJUL: 00.0000000000

You can change anything you want on the index and it will not hurt 
the Chip's Challenge game. But, before you change any of the X, Y, 
XJUL and YJUL settings, look at all the different images that can 
be found in the pictures on the screen. You can change the palette 
and cycle rate without messing up the programmed images. NOTE: 
There are two different programs to play with in this game. To 
see the other images other than Mandlebrot's, go to the index and 
push OPTION 2. It will change the title from MANDLEBROT EXPLORER 
to JULIA SET EXPLORER.

PAUSE + Option 1: This resets to the original viewing coordinates of 
		  the set.

PAUSE + Option 2: This copies the X,Y coordinate to the Julia set index,
		  enables Julia set mode and switches to the original 
		  viewing coordinates.

That's all there is to this program. Hope this help's you have 
lots of fun exploring the infinite images of the fractal 
generator.

NOTE: These instructions have been created by KALE SWINDELL 1990, 
and updated by Harry Dodgson 1994.

The Lynx Mandelbrot code does 48-bit fixed-point math using 8 bits of
integer and 40 bits of fraction, via the hardware multiplier (16x16) and a
lot of help from the 65C02.  The comment line on it (the source) says it
was written by Steve Landrum of Blue Lightning fame.

>From: dab1@ukc.ac.uk

First, get the notebook from the chest of drawers. Go into the bedroom and
get the tinder box from the table and the crucifix from the bed.  Use the
crucifix. Go to the dining room, get the oil from the table. Talk to
Dracula, and immediately afterwards, use the notebook. Go to the
antechamber, open the window and look out of it. Use the notebook. Climb
out of the window and go to the next window on the right.  This room should
be the bedroom.  Open the window and climb out of it. Make your way to the
top right window (it should be a big window like the one you climbed out of
initially). Examine the table, then use the notebook. Get the lantern, fill
it with oil and light it with the tinderbox. Go through the door on the
right into Dracula's money room. Get some money, get the box, then open the
box. Use the iron key you find in it on the door. Go into the crypt. Turn
the lantern so that it says "The lantern has been turned down". Go down,
right. Get the twine. Go right, down, down. Get the crowbar, examine the
coffin, use the notebook. Find your way back to Dracula's study. Climb out
of the window, and go back to the top left hand window. Go to the south
wing landing and use the crowbar on the door. Enter the sewing room. Wait
to be returned to the bedroom and then use the notebook. Climb out of the
window and go to the top left hand one. Go to the dining room, get the
sugar from the table. Go back to Dracula's study and get the lantern. Light
the lantern with the tinderbox and enter the catacombs again. Go down,
right, right, down, down. Get the small brass key from the coffin. Return
to the south hallway and use the small brass key to open the clock. Get the
small key. Return to Dracula's study, examine the desk and then use the
notebook. Get the hook from the drawer. Go to the money room and turn the
lever on the bottom wall. Enter the library through the door which opens
and examine the books. Examine the book you get, then tie the twine to the
hook. Enter the catacombs and go down, right, up, up. Climb the ladder and
then use the sugar on the horse. Get the spade and use it on the well. The
fishing line on the well, then climb down the well. THE END.

Crash the game:

     To crash the game go to either level 5 or 9 and get as many programs
hacking the door codes as possible. It may be best to set the code to the
one over the actual code (See above) so the program won't find the code too
soon.


Level select:

     Turn off your sound at title screen, now hold up and left on the
joypad and keep tapping both A & B buttons until it says "LEVEL 1" instead
of "NOW TELEPORING TO LEVEL 1".  Use joypad to choose level. (from

[GAT]=====================================================================
			     GATES OF ZENDOCON
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Following are all of the codes, maps, and some hints for GATES OF
ZENDOCON: SPOILER WARNING: If you enjoy discovering things for 
yourself, you should probably stop here.  This file takes a lot of the
fun out of it!


General Strategies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
GZ's monsters are completely predictable:  Every time you play a
level, they will appear in the same places, in the same sequence.
In addition, the "alien helpers" and other objects in the level appear
in the same places. Thus, the key to mastering a level is to first
explore the level.  Move your ship up and down, up and down, as you
proceed through the level, so you can see everything that's there.
You might have to sacrificing your ship lots of times before you
manage to get the whole level explored.  After you know what's there,
you can develop the best strategy for getting through the level.  This
might involve moving your ship as little as possible to reduce risk,
or it might involve moving it as much as possible so as to blow away
more aliens.

The Levels
~~~~~~~~~~

In the listing for each level, the gate(s) which exist on that level
are indicated with a letter, an arrow "->", and the name of the level
which that gate leads to.  Different letters indicate different
possible positions of the gate, as shgown in this diagram:
     +--------------------------+
     |             B            |
     |           A   D        E |
     |             C            |
     +--------------------------+
This is meant to be a schematic representation of the level; your ship
starts out at the left and proceeds towards the right.

For example, in the first level ("BASE"), it says "A -> ZYBX, E ->
RAZE". This means that there are two gates: one at position "A", and
another at position "E".  You have to go through two "waves" of alien
attack to get to a gate at position "E".

Each level's entry also tells which "friendly aliens" can be found on
that level, and where.  The symbols used are as follows:

@:  "Floating Eye".  Hovers below your ship and shoots a fireball
     horizontally.
*:  "Plasma Ball".  Hovers above and behind your ship, until you fire,
     at which point it wanders off (usually towards the closest enemy)
     and attempts to destroy enemies by touching them.
^:  "Death Arising".  Hovers above your ship and shoots a red "laser
     beam" straight up.
>:  "Sonic Dart".  Hovers above and slightly ahead of your ship and
     shoots a vertical white "sonic pulse", which moves to the right
     and enlarges as it moves away.  The result is a continuous
     triangular wave of pulses which "sweeps out" virtually everthing
     in front of your ship.


The description also tells where the alien is found.  Note:  You won't
find the alien if your ship is already accompanied by an alien of the
same type.

The levels are numbered in such a way that the gates always lead you
to a higher-numbered level.  Also, whenever possible consecutive
levels have been given consecutive numbers.  (Most levels only have
one gate.)

 1. BASE: A -> ZYBX, E -> RAZE
 2. ZYBX: B -> NYXX, C -> XRXS, D -> NEAT
 3. XRXS: A -> ANEX
 4. ANEX: A -> NEAT, E -> BARE
 5. NEAT: A -> YARR
 6. YARR: B -> EYES. *: Near bottom, at end.
 7. EYES: A -> NYXX, D -> BARE
 8. NYXX: C -> ZYRB. @: Near top of screen.
 9. ZYRB: A -> SRYX
10. SRYX: A -> BARE
11. BARE: A -> STAX, D -> XRAY
As soon as possible, move the ship straight up to the top of the
playfield.  Do *not* move left or right.  The dragon will fly into
your tailjets and get killed instantly.

A description of the "real" strategy for killing the dragon is given
below under level "NERB".

12. XRAY: A -> RATT.  *: Near top of screen.
13. RATT: A -> NYET
14. NYET: A -> RAZE

One easy way to get through this level is to stay on the bottom and
never shoot.  Of course, you don't get many points this way!

15. STAX: A -> SZZZ
16. SZZZ: A -> RAZE.  *: Middle of screen, at beginning.
17. RAZE: A -> TRYX,  B -> ROXX, C -> TRAX, D -> TERA
18. ROXX: A -> NERB
19. NERB: A -> TREY.  @: Stay above partition, after dragon.

The dragon in this level is like the one in "BARE":  It can be killed
only by having its "head" contact your tailjets.  None of the alien
helpers affects the dragon.

To slay the dragon, note that it travels on a grid of circles.  It
will always stay in this grid.  



Here's a rough sketch:

   :       :       :       :
    '.   .' '.   .' '.   .'
     .'''.   .'''.   .'''.
   .'     '.'     '.'     '.
   :       :xxx    :       :
   '.     .'.     .'.     .'
     '...'   '...'   '...'
    .'   '. .'   '. .'   '.
   :       :       :       :

The dots, quotes, and colons represent the path of the dragon. The key
is to get your ship into the position marked "xxx" in the center of
one of the circles.  Avoid the dragon until you can see where the
"center of the circle" is, and then put your ship there when the
dragon is out of the way.

Once in the center of the circle, your ship is entirely safe.  After a
while, the dragon's path repeats; when it comes round the circle
again, it will fly through your tailjets and die.

(Actually, this doesn't always happen.  Sometimes your ship is a
little too far to the right and the dragon will just "chirp" a little
as it goes by.  If this happens, move your ship to the left a *tiny*
bit and wait for him to come around again.

Note:  This strategy has to be modified somewhat in "SSSS", where you
get more than one dragon at a time.

20. TREY: A -> STAR.  >: Third set of partitions, top.
21. STAR: D -> SSSS, C ->BYTE.  @: First set of partitions, bottom.
The "B" gate is under the second partition.  It's also sort of hard to
enter.

22. SSSS: A -> BREX
The dragons in this level come in groups of two or three.  This makes
things more difficult, because they don't always travel on the same
"grid".

The strategy is the same, but since the dragons travel on different
grids, you'll have to keep moving your ship.  If you can't move fast
enough, use your shields -- they will get you out of the way much more
quickly. (However, you'll be dead if you're caught between two dragons
or caught between a dragon and the edge of the playfield.) Dodge the
dragons repeatedly until you see what pattern they follow. Each one
follows a repeating path.  Then, kill them off one-by-one, using the
method described in "NERB".


23. TERA: A -> BYTE
24. BYTE: A -> BETA.  >: Near bottom of screen.
25. BETA: B -> TRAX,  E -> NEST
26. TRAX: A -> ZEBA
27. ZEBA: A -> TRYX, E -> ROXY.  @: Near top.
28. TRYX: B -> STYX
In this level, the "floor" restricts the ship to the top half of the
play-field.  However, there is a "hidden feature" or "easter-egg"
which allows you to access another gate "below the floor".  Here's how
you find it:

 *** HEY!  WOULDN'T YOU RATHER FIND THIS FOR YOURSELF?  I THOUGHT
 *** SO.  IF YOU'RE NOT A WIMP, YOU'LL SKIP THE NEXT FEW PARAGRAPHS.

Immediately put on your shields and move the ship down, to kill the
alien tanks.  Then, start dropping bombs (using your shields when
necessary to kill newly-appearing aliens).  You will notice at one
point the bombs appear to go through the floor.  At this location is
an invisible "hole" through which you can fly your ship.

It will probably take a few tries before you get through, because the
hole is rather small.  Once you get through, you maneuver through a
couple of minor obstacles and then find the gate.  It leads you to the
"easter-egg level", whose name is "    ".  (Four blank spaces: this
level, therefore, can't be accessed directly as the others can because
its name cannot be entered.)

The easter-egg level is fun.  It also gives you all four alien
helpers: @, *, >, and ^.

 *** END OF WIMP'S SECTION ***

29. STYX: A -> YARB
30. YARB: A -> BREX
31. ROXY: A -> NEXA
32. NEXA: A -> NEST
33. NEST: A -> EBYX
34. EBYX: A -> BREX.  *: Middle of screen (can't miss it).
35. "    ": A -> NERB.  *, @, ^, >: all near bottom, near beginning.
This is the easter-egg level.  Description of level "TRYX" above
tells you how to get here.

Since this level leads back to an "earlier level", it is possible
to loop, and thus (in theory) to play Gates of Zendocon forever:
NERB->TREY->STAR->BYTE->BETA->TRAX->ZEBA->TRYX->here->back to NERB.

36. BREX: B -> ZEST, C -> SEBB, D -> STAB.  ^: Near bottom, after
a long sequence of towers with yellow-and-gray pyramid-shaped tops.

37. ZEST: A -> ZORT.  *: Bottom of screen, under stalactite.
38. ZORT: B -> STAB, E -> BRAN
39. BRAN: A -> BROT
40. STAB: A -> BOXX.  @: Middle of screen, at beginning.
41. BOXX: C -> SEBB, E -> TENT
Here's a map of this level.  "[]" represents a box which is hard to
shoot, "<>" represents one which is easy.  "C" and "E" show the
locations of the gates.

42. TENT: A -> BROT.  *: Near middle.
43. SEBB: A -> SNEX.  ^: Near bottom.
44. SNEX: C -> ZAXX
Yes, the "tank/truck" objects can be destroyed!  However, it's a very
complex operation.  
     1: Wait until the first tank is about halfway across the screen.
     2: Move behind its cannon, then down behind it after the 2-legged
	walker isout of the way.
     3: Follow it closely, and simultaneously maneuver the ship so
	that it's 3 pixels off the floor.  Move almost all the way to
	the edge of the screen.
     4: Keep the lasers on continuously.  This should kill additional
	walkers as they approach.
     5: As each additional tank piles up behind you, the score
	increments by increasing amounts.  When the score is
	incrementing 10 at a time, the one's digit will be constant.
	Shortly after this happens, you will kill a walker.  Just
	after the walker is killed, move up slightly, wait for a
	missile to fly just under you, then move back down into
	position.
     6: Continue to the end.  When the screen stops scrolling, leave
	your ship still for a bit; the tanks will all simultaneously
	be destroyed.

45. ZAXX: A -> BROT
46. BROT: A -> STOB.  >: Near bottom.
So-named because of the Mandelbrot Sets used in the background?

47. STOB: A -> XTNT
48. XTNT: A -> BOTZ
49. BOTZ: A -> SNAX
50. SNAX: A -> ZETA, D -> NEAR
51. NEAR: A -> ZETA.  *: Near bottom.  @: Near top, immediately after
*.  >: Near bottom, shortly after @.

52. ZETA
This is the "penultimate level", as it were.  The object is to shoot
at the object which slowly moves up and down along the right edge of
the screen. Every now and then, this object will "open its eye"; this
is the only time when it's vulnerable.  The second time you
successfully hit it when its eye is open, everything on the screen
blows up and you are sent to the endgame.

NOTE: If you have alien companions, they will be destroyed along with
everything else!  (However, they still help you get through this
level.)  The consequence of this is that when you face Zendocon, you
always face it alone.

53. Endgame
In the final screen, you fight it out with Zendocon itself, the evil
spider-monster which rules all the other aliens you've been fighting.
To make it through this level, use the following procedure:
Zendocon appears on the right edge of the screen and moves
horizontally towards you.  While firing the lasers continuously, move
your ship down slowly.  You will eventually find a point at which your
lazer-fire makes "explosions" appear on the monster.

When Zendocon is getting close, move your ship to the left and *up*
out of the way.  It can touch your ship without hurting you, but you
want to avoid having it cover your ship entirely.  Use your shields if
it's a close call.

When it starts heading back towards the right, move your ship back
down to fire at Zendocon's "soft spot" again.  Use your shields when
necessary to keep the "eyeballs" from hitting you.  After the first
couple of left-right "cycles" of Zendocon's movement, you'll be able
to position your ship so that you can hit the soft spot and also avoid
touching the eyeballs (because Zendocon slowly drifts up as it moves
back and forth.)

Using this technique, you should be able to hit Zendocon enough so
that it dies after five or six repetitions of its left-right path.
If you don't, it will start moving around the screen diagonally.  This
means it's probably too late -- but in a last-ditch effort, put on
your shields and fly into its "mouth".  This might do it in.

If you kill Zendocon and then "commit suicide" by crashing your ship
into the floating eyes, you're given another ship and have to kill
Zendocon again.  If you lose your last ship in this way, you lose the
game. Killing Zendocon multiple times doesn't increase your score all
that much, but it's something to do if you have lots of extra ships at
the end of the game.


Shortest Route From Start to Finish
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fifteen screens, plus Zendocon.  There are three equally short paths
from BREX to BROT:
				   ,->ZEST->ZORT->BRAN-.
BASE->RAZE->TRYX->STYX->YARB->BREX--->STAB->BOXX->TENT--->BROT-.
				   `->SEBB->SNEX->ZAXX-'       |
			     ,---------------------------------'
			     `->STOB->XTNT->BOTZ->SNAX->ZETA->endgame

At BASE, take the second gate.  At RAZE, take the first.  At TRYX,
STYX, and YARB you have no choice (disregarding the easter-egg in
TRYX).  At BREX, choose whichever path you like best (if you choose
the upper path, take the second gate at ZORT; if you choose the middle
path, take the second gate at BOXX.)  From BROT to SNAX you have no
choice; at SNAX take the first gate.

A typical final score for the "shortest route" is around 100,000.
(Or 10,000,000 in the "hard" mode -- good luck!)

Gates of Zendocon Map:

     Each level's gates are numbered left to right, top to bottom, as the

[GAU]=====================================================================
				 GAUNTLET
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Solving the plant problem in the last level (Level 40):

1)  Take the first plant in the second group of plants. It will spit you 
    out of another plant.
2)  Escape from this plant and take the top plant of the four.  This will 
    spit you out between two more plants.
3)  Take the left-most plant and get the Star Gem!  Immediately give it to 
    Noj and all the robots turn to gold.

To Select Levels

1)      Choose your character.
2)      Start the game, but DO NOT move your character.
3)      Press the OPTION 1 button, this will take you to Level 5.
4)      Repeat this to go to Levels 10, 15, and 20.


[KLA]=====================================================================
				    KLAX
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can warp to level 56 by getting a "Big X" on level 11. You can also
warp to level 51 by getting a "Big X" on level 6. Both of these give you
bonuses of ~60,000 points.

Strategy Guide:

  In order to excell at KLAX, in addition to improving your reflexes and
anticipation, you need to understand the scoring rules. It is possible to
get more than 2,000,000 if you know the tricks ;-) !

  There are three basic areas of scoring to be considered:

     1.  Basic scores for KLAXs
     2.  The score multiplier
     3.  End-of-level and warp bonuses

I will deal primarily with the first two, since there is relatively little
the player can do about the last.  The basic KLAX scoring matrix is shown
below:

		   vertical        horizontal      diagonal

   3-KLAX               50            1,000          5,000
   4-KLAX           10,000            5,000         10,000
   5-KLAX           15,000           10,000         20,000

Why?  I don't know.  I didn't design it.  I'm just reporting the facts,
ma'am.  Anyway, note that a vertical 3-KLAX is worthless, but a vertical
4-KLAX is quite valuable!  The message is that when you are going for
points, go for diagonal KLAXs or vertical 4-KLAXs.

  So how do you get a vertical 4-KLAX?  Doesn't it go away when you put the
3rd tile on top? Well, the answer is no, not always. There are two basic ways
to get a vertical 4-KLAX.  The easiest is to use the scoring delay.  If
you have the following setup:

	   [b]                What you want to do is drop the [b] tile
	   [a]                on the center column in the bin, and while
	   [a]                it is scoring, move over and drop both [a]
	   ===                tiles on top of the [a] column.  The two
			      [a] tiles will just sit there until the
    |               |         [b] column finishes scoring, then all of
    |               |         the [a]'s will score as a vertical 4-KLAX.
    |               |
    |      [b][a]   |         Simple !
    |      [b][a]   |
    +---------------+


  The second way to get a vertical 4-KLAX is to set up chain-reaction
techniqes:

	[b]                   When you drop the [b] down, it will score
	===                   a diagonal 3-KLAX.  When the [b]'s all
			      disappear, voil`a, a vertical 4-KLAX
    |         [a]   |         of [a]'s!
    |         [a]   |
    |         [b]   |
    |      [b][a]   |
    |      [x][a]   |
    +---------------+

  These examples also introduce the score multiplier effect.  Whenever
you score, the score mutliplier is the number of KLAXs scored.  This
multiplier doesn't reset but keeps increasing until there's nothing left
to score and play has resumed.  So in the above examples, the [b] KLAXs
had a multipler of 1, but the [a] KLAXs had a multipler of 2 and were
worth 20,000 points!

  For a more complex example (capital letters indicate scoring KLAXs):

	   [b]
	   [a]
	   ===

    |   [a]   [a]   |       |   [a]   [a]   |       |               |
    |   [a]   [a]   |       |   [a][a][a]   |       |   [A]   [A]   |
    |   [b]   [b]   |  -->  |   [B][B][B]   |  -->  |   [A][A][A]   |
    |   [a][x][a]   |       |   [a][x][a]   |       |   [A][x][A]   |
    |   [a][x][a]   |       |   [a][x][a]   |       |   [A][x][A]   |
    +---------------+       +---------------+       +---------------+

The [b]'s score as a horizontal 3-KLAX with mutiplier of 1, but the
[a]'s will score as 2 vertical 4-KLAXs, 2 diagonal 3-KLAXs, and a
horizontal 3-KLAX with a total multiplier of 6 (1 for the [b]'s and
5 for the [a]'s) !!!  So the total score for this would be:

   (mult  *  hor [b]) + (mult * (hor [a] + (2 * diag [a]) + (2 * vert [a])))
 = ( 1    *  1000 )   + ( 6   * ( 1,000  + (2 *  5,000)   + (2 * 10,000)))
 =      1000          + ( 6   * ( 31,000 ))
 =      187,000 points !!!!


  As you can see, the multiplier can have a dramatic effect on your score.
The maximum multiplier is 9 (athough it's quite difficult to get that high).

  As a final topic in this lesson, I want to cover a couple of advanced
techniques.

  You may have noticed during play that if you push forward on the joystick,
the top tile on your paddle will be thrown half way back up the ramp. You
can use this to rearrange the tiles on the paddle or to get back to a lower
tile without dropping the upper tiles. This "push-back" technique is fun.
It's addictive. It's also the quickest way to get into deep doo-doo. Use
it, don't abuse it.

  There is a built-in difficulty advance feature which makes the game play
faster depending on how long you have been playing on the current quarter.
(This is a not-very-well-kept secret of arcade game design used to balance
game play so a the designer doesn't have to screw typical players to keep
a really good player from playing forever).  Anyway, the point is that you
should play as quickly as possible so that the game difficulty doesn't
ramp up on you.  One way you do this by pulling back on the joystick to
speed the tiles down the ramp and (hopefully) onto your paddle.  Don't
wait for them to come to you.  Suck 'em down!  This feature can also be
abused (although not as badly as the push-back technique), but it can be
useful.

  The basic strategy is going top be to start at level 1, play through
level 5, warp to level 11, and take a "secret warp" to level 56.  I've
never survived level 56 using this strategy :-):-).


			       LEVEL 1

  Here is a cosmic paradox.  Level 1 is the easiest level in the game.  It
is also the hardest level to do well.  Don't get discouraged by the complexity
of the patterns (KLAXgrams) shown below.  This is the as bad as it gets, and
you can work up to it slowly.  If you wish, use the "Tengen Stax" method shown
below.  It's worth fewer points, but it is *lots* easier.

  There are only 4 colors of tiles in the first level. The patterns shown will
get you about 370,000 to 565,000 points on level 1.  The highest theoretical
score for level 1 that we have found is about 720,000 (but I wouldn't waste
my time trying for it -- and I play for free).  In building these patterns,
you may complete at most ONE KLAX to get rid of "junk"; if you complete 2
KLAXs, the game will not let you drop extra tiles on the paddle after the
first, because the 1st tile will complete the level.  And you must be quick
to drop all the tiles on the paddle into the center column.  If the top [c]
finishes scoring before you get the remaining tiles in place, things won't
work right.

  You must be prepared to settle for less and bail out earlier if necessary.
These are "best case" patterns.  They are very similar: notice that the only
difference in the first 2 is an extra [a] at the bottom of the paddle stack,
but it's surprisingly MUCH more difficult to achieve!  An [x] is a don't care:
use the fourth color or just make sure you don't complete a KLAX with them.

				   [c]                    [c]

						    "Rains' Revenge"


			       LEVEL 2

  This pattern is known as "Tengen Stax," because the guys over at Tengen
discovered it. I think it should be called "Stax to dah Max," but call it
whatever you want ("You can call me Ray, or you can call me Jay ...").  It
makes use of the high value of vertical 4-KLAXs.  It's also easy to remember
and is recommended for the entire family.  There are many minor variations
possible with higher and lower scores.  These are left as an exercise to
the reader.

	    [e]

     |[a][b]   [c][d]|
     |[a][b]   [c][d]|
     |[e][e]   [e][e]|
     |[a][b][e][c][d]|
     |[a][b][e][c][d]|
     +---------------+
       "Tengen Stax"


			      LEVEL 3

  Level 3 is a "diagonal wave".  Try to complete as much of a BIG X as possible
but bail out as soon as possible to keep the game difficulty down.  You need
at least 3 diagonals to complete the level.  You should have been using the
pull-down feature to save time so far.  Also, between levels keep tapping the
button to speed up the scoring (again, reducing time).  Again, many variations
are possible.

	    [a]
	    ===

     |[a]         [a]|
     |[x][a]   [a][x]|
     |[x][x]   [x][x]|
     |[x][a][x][a][x]|
     |[a][x][x][x][a]|
     +---------------+
	  "BIG X"


			      LEVEL 4

  Level 4 should be played the same as level 2.  There are more colors on level
4 than level 2, so it is harder.  But it is also more important to do well on
level 4 because it is a "points wave".  Any points that you score over the
10,000 needed to complete the level will be doubled as a bonus.  So a 200,000
set of "Tengen Stax" will get you 390,000 points including the bonus.  Did
I mention that furiously tapping through the scoring at the end of level
sometimes reveals a "feature" in which mysterious white tiles appear in the
bin and give you extra points?


			      LEVEL 5

  Just survive it any way you can.   The difficulty will be ramping up pretty
well by this time, so I just build simple vertical stacks to get rid of tiles
as easily as possible.  I often have over 1,000,000 by this time, and survival
is the most important thing.  DO NOT TAP THE BUTTON AT THE END OF THIS LEVEL
TO SPEED THE SCORE -- you may inadvertently get to the select screen and select
the default level 6.  When you get to the select screen, warp to level 11.

			 LEVELS 11 and 56

  I play both levels the same.  I go for a "Super Star" pattern which includes
an "X".  The "X" on level 11 (and on level 6, too) will cause an immediate
warp to level 56 (or 51), plus mucho bonus points.  This pattern depends on
getting a wild tile ([*]) to complete the star.  I still love completing this
pattern and watching everything score at once.


	    [*]
	    ===

     |[a]         [b]|
     |[x][a]   [b][x]|
     |[c][c]   [d][d]|
     |[x][b][e][a][x]|
     |[b][x][e][x][a]|
     +---------------+
       "Super Star"

	 *******************************************************

  Well, that's it.  If you did everything right (and if the game was kind to
you), you will have a score of over 2,000,000 points.  Now wasn't that easy?  
If you actually do this, you will amaze your friends (and yourself) and will 
probably dominate the high score table for awhile.  Have fun, keep kool, and 
happy KLAXing.                                             /*  Lyle Rains

Another Tip:

One thing to realize about making the big X, is that you don't need to make 
it all one color.  For example, the method I usually use is:

    |[A]         [B]|
    |[x][A]   [B][x]|
    |[x][x][*][x][x]|
    |[x][C][x][D][x]|
    |[C][x][x][x][D]|
    +---------------+

Where the "*" is a wildcard.  This is so easy to make that I can always do 
it on level 6.

important message

we're going for the
record now..  What's the
largest scrolly mesage
ever seen on a game cartridge?
no idea? miniscule, thats what.

we at dma design in our shiny green office
building are attempting 40k worth of message.
pointless, futile,  mesage.  thats 40960 characters.
we even employ someone purely to write these scrolly
mesages.  we have more text.

loads!

loads!!

loads!!!

and then some!!!!!!

speaking of characters,
there were some very
strange ones involved
in creating the game. I
myself am a member of the
the guild of scrolly
message writers, not 
the everyday messages
that get flung around
on demos but a bona
fide scrolly embedded on
a rom cartridge. few are
qualified to reach this
level of expertise.  if you
wish to do this youself
there are special night
classes you can attend.  you
just have to know where to
find them.

thanks go especially to the
sandwich ladies and the
chocolate cake that caused me
so much trauma trying to
slim down..


so anyway, in several
thousand years time 
some archeologist is
going to dig up this
cartridge. i may as
well explain a few things
about 1993

first of all the
location of atlantis.
it is in fact in the
tay estuary just next
to dundee, sctoland

that fact alone explains
why atlantis has remained
so quiet over the years.
who could take them seriously
nowdays with the think highland
accent and a claymore 

come to think of it, wielding a claymore in
front of people does tend to make them take you 
seriously.  so why did atlatis sink?
it was the constant rainfall that did it.

I may as well tell you
that the scrolly
message classes are
held at the following
address.

the university
1 south underwater st
west 15
atlantis

enclose around 20 quids
worth of stamps for all
correspondance

and now vampires.

are you one of the
legions of the undead?
does the sun make you
peel until there is
nothing left?  do
hordes of irate locals
armed with sunbeds try
to ruin your night?

if the answer to any of 
the above questions is
a resounding yes then
you really have got problems 
I suppose in
that case you'll have 
been playing lemmings
in the middle of a 
transylvanian castle
in the basement.
in that case, make sure
you've got plenty of
batteries.

can't leave out aliens:
why would anyone wish to
leave aliens out of a scolly
message (a note for the
pedantic: under no cimcumstances
is a message text called a scolling
message, it is always a called a scolly )

so anyway: aliens.  we
are of course talking
about the suckers that
come from space and not
the ones that try sneak
in you're country when
you're not looking.

I am confident that no-one
at dma design has in fact
been abducted by aliens
although several of them may
actually be aliens themselves.
have you ever seen whitley
strieber's communion?
if so then i can give
the true explanation.
the alien is large, white, bald and has enormous 
eyes.  now consider what michael
jackson is doing to himself, and
it will instantly become clear that this is what
michael will look like in several hundred years.
considering his reputation for eccentricity and
his vast wealth i have no doubt that
he will fund a time machine and go back to the
eighties and pretend to be from outer space.  or not.

a word about piracy.
yes, even cartidges
can be copied.  it's
not very nice is it?
if you do try it then the
jokes on you.  inserted
into this text is a 
powerful magical spell
to shred the very soul
of evil nasty people who
would take away our livelihood.


nasty pirate
go way.
you'll never live,
to see the day,
when evil triumphs
over light,
'cos we all think
you're full of

* zzzt * software
failure there* mmm,
never mind. on with
the next topic.  the
pentagram graphics
should take care of
it anyway.

7k of message!

ah we never quite
got to 40K but I think
it is still enough
to count.

i think it's a...
world record
for a console cartridge.

you!

until next time

a little message from
the programmer.

enjoy your lynx.  it is
the best of all of the
hand held portable machines.
only with your support can
we produce software for this
lovely little piece of
hardware with a goal
keeping the machine alive and kicking

well i may not have plans
to do anything in the immediate
future on the lynx, but if it is still around in a few
years maybe I'll do lemmings ii on it.

then again maybe not
i suppose i would have to 
be mad to attempt it but then
again anyone who attempts a major
programming feat using a 6502 must be mad
but don't forget the lovely hardware
this little machine can do more to the
display than an amiga
can thanks to rj mical and his team
for being insane enough to design such
a nice piece of hardware and having the foresight
to produce their development software on the amiga
maybe it's because they
had something to do with that as well?

bye...

[HOC]=====================================================================
				    HOCKEY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Play with the PERFECT Hockey Team!

Enter the password "BATSXPEB".  The "X" will turn into a heart and then 
pressing "OK" brings up a Bat cartoon with the lines

YES SIR.
NO SIR.
THREE BAGS
FULL SIR.

Then when you go to the play game screen, you can choose a new team from 
Group D:  "The Bats", which has *perfect* stats! Two notes: if you try to 
re-enter the password BATSXPEB then you get a still pic of a bat (sleeping?) 
with the message

BORING.

Also, the Bats are an American team, since the anthem played for them
is the US National Anthem.  (There is also some color change of the
LA Kings uniform, possible others... but I am not familiar enough
with these teams to know... we don't see much Hockey down here in
New Orleans...).

[RAM]=====================================================================
				  RAMPAGE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's a trick that will let you select ANY level in Rampage.

When the character selection screen appears, pause and unpause the game. 
Now when the game continues on to the headlines screen(you must, of course,  
select a character.) hold down option 1 and move the joypad.  Now you can 
select ANY LEVEL!

 
Showing the digitized picture of the programmer 
(it is very nicely done and even has some "animation"):

Activate the level select trick (Pause and unpause when choosing your 
monster). At the newspaper, hold down Option 1 and select Day 6. Press
Pause twice. Hold down Option 1 and select Day 15. Press Pause twice. Hold
down Option 1, Option 2, and the 'B' button simultaneously. The game will
end, but there will be a "smiling programmer" instead of the winning
monster.

[RAP]=====================================================================
				  RAMPART
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Play a two player game in single player mode:

Clear two veteran levels (the topmost and then the leftmost battlefield).
At the Map screen, push the joypad left as if you were trying to select a 
different battlefield than the one remaining. The highlight will disappear. 
If you then start, you will be on one of the two player battle fields.  I 
think that you actually can choose from any of them, by continuing to move 
the cursor off screen, but I'm not sure.

Playing tip!

During the cannon stage, if you click five times on a place where the cannon 
can't be built, you'll go on ahead to the firing stage. One strategy is to 
place the cannon over a boat you plan to target and click five times, so that 
when you start the firing stage the crosshairs will already be over the boat.

If it starts getting a little hairy when you try to refortify your castle
(ie. to cluttered with wall remnants), then try clearing those pieces away
in the next cannon stage by shooting them. 

[ROA]=====================================================================
			       ROAD BLASTERS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to skip levels in RoadBlasters.

Start game normally and choose the Rookie starting area.  Accelerate car, 
while holding down the "B" button to about 25 - 50 mph and steer the car so 
that it is riding on the left shoulder of the road.  Keep holding down the 
"B" button.

Eventually, you will hit a tree which is growing on the side of the road. 
When you do this you will see a digitized picture of one of the programers 
and a short message.

You will also see in the upper right hand corner a number. This is the level 
you are on. Use the OPTION 1 button to move the number forward, and OPTION 2 
to move the number backward. (Note: gently tap the OPTION keys. This function 
really zooms thru the levels.)

Once you get to the level you want to play, press the "A" button. You're now 
back in the game. you will now continue to finish level 1, then the next level 
will be the level above the one you chose, i.e. if you picked level 48, after 
you finish level one, you'll be on level 49.

[RYG]=====================================================================
				   RYGAR
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Floating shield trick: 

Throw the shield in front of you, then restart the game with Option 1 and 
Pause. When you restart the game, your shield will be floating in front of 
you. As soon as you fire, your shield returns to normal. (programming glitch?)

Playing tip for level 19:

Level 19, in which you hop from level to level with fireballs underfoot and
a blueish background, is pretty hard. The simplest way to pass it is to
wait for a bird to fly at you from the left, hop up as it swoops at you, then
"ride" it across the screen to the right until you get past the hard parts
by hopping to the right on each bounce so you stay above this one bird.
For some reason the bat comes out and lets you kill it anyway on level 19.
On other levels this tactic is inadvisable because the bat won't come out
until you get on the rope and you can easily lose all your lives as a result.

[SCR]=====================================================================
			       SCRAPYARD DOG
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Free Shield

METHOD 1:

     At the start of any level, move Louie half way across the screen, then
pause and press the B button. If you did this right (positioning is very
important), You should see a message at the bottom of the screen that says 
"SHIELD AWARDED."

METHOD 2:

     When the timer reads 299 press pause, then press button B (this is a more
reliable method than method 1). In the beginning this always work, but not in
later levels.


Scrapyard Dog Cheat

     Here is a method I used to obtain lots of shields and lives in Scrapyard
Dog.  If a shop you are about to enter has a red $5 money bag on the same
screen, take the money before entering the shop.  Then exit the shop.  The $5
money bag will appear again.  Take the money and enter the shop again.  Repeat
this over and over to build up your money supply.  Don't worry about losing a
life or two by running out of time for the level because just ahead in another
shop, you will buy yourself more lives ($35) and max out your shields ($10) to
nine.  This method can be used on another level towards the end of the game to
get lots of lives.


WARP to FOREST

     To perform the warp, you must be on JUNKYARD Level 2.  Move right through
the level to the stack of tires.  Jump onto tires and press down.  The can room
will appear.  The following table show where the arrow starts and where the
prize ends up:

     Start   Finish
       1       5
       2       1
       3       4
       4       2
       5       3

You are now small in size.  This allows you to knock on the WARP door and warp.
As you move to the right, press up in front of the tree to get an extra life.
Keep  moving to the right and avoid being hit by bullets, dogs, mice, and bird
dropings.  Jump up where the hub caps are hanging on a line to get
invincibility.   Also pressing down while on top of the third brown can (the
one to the left of the mouse caught between cans) will give you a shield.  When
you get to the toilet just before the office, jump up on the toilet.  Face left
and hold down.  A red warp door will appear to the right of the office.  Move
over to the door and hold up to open door and warp.


WARP to DESERT

     To perform the warp, you must be on CITY Level 1.  Move to the right until
you get to the black cat up in the window above the mail box.  Throw a can to
get rid of the cat.  Jump up to window where cat was and press up.  You will
now be small.  Move back to the left to door by mail box.  Jump up steps to get
level with door.  Hold up while in front of door to get red warp door to appear
above the door.  Now quickly jump onto mail box, jump to the left edge of the
screen while holding the jump button (to achieve a higher jump).  This will put
you at the red warp door.  Press/hold up in front of door to warp.

WARP to MOUNTAIN

     When small, look in the base of the tree near the second white cat. The 
red door will appear at the top of the screen, on a cloud, almost out of sight.

WARP to ARTIC

     You must be in the FOREST level 1.  At the start of the level, move to the 
right to the log when the rabbit comes out.  When you jump on the log over the 
hole where the rabbit came out, press down on the joypad.  You are know small.
If you go to the right, you will encounter a tree with two snakes.  Enter the
door to enter the shop.  Exit the shop and the snakes are gone.  Now jump on 
the stump to the right of the shop. Face left and hold down till the WARP door
appears on the branch.  Jump up to the door and press up.  You will now warp to
the ICE area.


     These are the only warps that I found in the game.  There may be more.
Hope this helps you out!

[SHA]=====================================================================
			    SHADOW OF THE BEAST
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Keep in mind when you read this that Beast is an arcade game, thus
just knowing how to do this may not be enough. Quick reflexes may be
necessary. Also, my strategy is not perfect in places... if you know how to
improve my technique (ie, you don't get hit as much) let me know
(tazzzzz@eecs.umich.edu).

     Outside. Start by running to the left. Watch for the bats that will
fly down (I've only made it through here unscathed a couple times, normally
I just run back to the right a little bit and duck when I hear the bats
shriek). There are two different sets of bats, and each set of bats will
attack in two different smaller groups. As soon as you get past the second
set of bats, there are three metal traps in the ground. All you need to do
is jump and land between the sets of "jaws". Enter the tree (there is
nothing of value further to the left).

     In the tree, part one. The small head at the bottom of the staircase
will shoot at you when you get a certain distance from it (something you're
bound to discover on your own!). Climb down the ladder and head to the
left. The game progresses pretty linearly here. You've got a few platforms
to jump and a few monsters to dispose of, but there's really only one way
to go. When you get past the green guys with the swords (watch out for
those spikes overhead!), climb up the ladder and head to the right (passing
the next ladder which is heading up) until you come to the ladder that goes
down. A bit more jumping on platforms and you'll come to a blue total
health restoring potion. Things progress a bit more and you will encounter
these golden flying things. When you are at this point, you will climb down
a ladder and find a silvery (but with red center) circular device stuffed
in a corner to the right (somewhat near a big skeleton lodged in the wall).
This is a teleporter that will take you back a ways. Don't use it yet.
Instead, head to the left, ignoring the ladder heading down.

     Next, you will come to the weird eagle thing that is holding a blue
crystal globe. Time his fire-breathing activities and get up close to him
when he's not scorching the air in your vicinity. Ducking will avoid the
fire. Then, when he's not breathing fire, punch the globe (it will flash
each time you hit it). I counted eleven hits for it to be finished. You
will then have the blue globe in your inventory (you'll get to use it soon
enough). Head back to the right the way you came, and then take the ladder
down.

     You will climb down a jog in the ladders, and then head left instead
of down. To the left, you will find an area with a key. I've found it
easiest to jump off of the moving platform into that section and then
getting onto the up-down moving platform without the resident blue guy
seeing me. (Basically don't walk to the left at all after jumping off of
that moving platform. Just hop straight onto the up-down platform). Now,
head back to the right. If you need health, climb down that ladder that I
told you not to climb down before and head to the left. All the way left is
a blue complete health restoration potion.

     I have a hint for this whole section. I found it much quicker to avoid
catching all the ropes and jumping on all the platforms by simply falling
off the ledges. The health potions were conveniently spaced so that I could
easily survive these falls (watch out for spikes though!) and leave this
area with full health. Climb back up the ladders and hop in the teleporter.

     After teleporting, hit option 1 and select the blue globe. The blue
globe gives you a nifty missile weapon. Head left and climb up the ladder.
When you move to the right, a wall will rise sealing you from escape! There
is a lone spike "bush" in the middle of this little battlefield. Stand with
the Beast's right foot just about touching the left edge of the bush. When
the monster rises up, duck. You should be below his shots. Note that before
he rises up, he will fire one shot. Try to jump over them, but they don't
do too much damage so don't worry too much. I comfortably get four shots in
before I have to duck. It takes fifteen shots total (don't waste these
shots, I've found them useful later). Hit option 1 and select "exit" in
order to go back to regular punches. Off to the right, you enter the second
half of the tree and a new save point!

     In the tree, part two. As you run to the right, you will run past a
machine with a lever, gears and a chain coming out of the top. Ignore that
for the moment, and jump over the spikes. After you climb down the ladder,
there will be some snakes coming out of the floor and spitting at you. Just
run up to them and punch them after they spit. After the second and third
snakes a bird thing will fly down and you will need to duck. Don't take the
downward ladder after the snakes. Instead, pick up the gear and head back
to the machine. Once there, hit option 1 and select the gear. Assuming
you're standing close to the machine, the gear will go in place. Punch the
lever and a platform will lower. Climb onto the platform and punch the
lever again to go up. Go to the right and get the torch hanging from a
support pole. Head left, beat up some green guys and flip the switch on the
wall. Climb up the ladder you past when you went to flip the switch, and
head left past the bouncing eyeballs (!?). When the dragon stops breathing
fire, run, pick up the key and stand next to him and wait out his next
attack. After that, run back to the right and past the eyeballs. If you
need health, head to the right and pick up the blue potion. Otherwise, head
back down the ladder and the "elevator". Go past the snakes again, and then
head downward. Head right and punch the lever. Then turn back and cross the
platform that had been extended across what used to be a gap. Punch the
lever you find off to the left and then go back to the right and downard
(gadzooks! They've got you running back and forth!). Run left after getting
to the bottom of the ladder and use the moving platforms to take you
further left. You will find a blue "glove" suspended in midair. If it's
surrounded by electricity, you forgot to flip the switch in the hallway
underneath those bouncing eyeballs. As you head back right past the ladder,
a couple of those red batlike things will fly down. Try to hit them,
because now is a good time to conserve health. You've got a ways to go
before a refill. Continue on downward and avoid the obstacles (I have
really got much to comment on here. Just practice your timing around the
spikes and try not to get hit.) When you get to the ghosts, if you head
right instead of down the ladder to the left you can avoid having to deal
with these rocket engines that are mysteriously igniting. However, only
avoid those engines if you have the health to take a fall into spikes (and
you must also be confident of your ability to get rid of the dragon). Hit
option 1 and select the yellow glove. You can't kill the dragon without it.
If you watch the timing, you will notice that the spike will drop to the
floor and the dragon will stop breathing fire. That is when you need to
jump across. You can comfortably punch the dragon five times before you
need to jump back across when the spike is down. It takes a total of thirty
hits to blast this guy. Use the yellow key you picked up to leave the tree
area through the well.

     Topside once again. All right! So we're out of that hellhole of a
tree. Well, there's still a bunch of ickyness to deal with up top. First,
stand in front of the cannon. After the nifty little green dude lights the
fuse (wait for it to be burning), punch the cannon. The little guy gets
blast and leaves a handy gun behind. Now, head back to the right
eliminating the baddies that you encounter. The columns that look like
piles of rock contain potentially useful items (there is only one evil
column in the game, and that comes near the end). The first two you come
across have health bonuses. The last one contains a large ball. Push the
ball along with you as you avoid the spikes and use it to plug up a hole
from which some green and red balls are popping. When you get to the funky
pterodactyl statue, don't be alarmed. This is actually a pretty easy
monster. He does a bit of damage if he hits you, so don't let him. Punch
the statue five times to let the monster out, and then punch him three
times to take back the freedom you just gave him. I personally hate the
spider forest that comes next, but at least there is health afterwards. 
To get past each spider, wait until the spike on the right has just come down,
and walk over until you are directly to the left of the spider. Punch the 
spider, wait until just before it hits the ground, and jump into the air. Let 
the spider go under you, and move slightly to the right to land where the 
spider had been, between the spikes. Wait until the spike on the right has
just come down, and walk to the right. The second time you repeat this 
process there will be a spider running along the ground which you must 
jump over. The eyeballs aren't too bad once you see the holes that you can 
rest in. Duck as the green guy flies overhead, and then punch him as he 
comes back around but lower. When the flying dragon drops the winged bomb, 
punch the bomb before it explodes and it will eradicate the annoying swarm 
of insects. I think you can handle the rest of the obstacles until you get 
to the castle.

     In the castle. Go left, past the ladder, and get rid of the green,
hoppy guys. Flip the switch. Go back and climb the ladder.  You can only
punch wooden barrels; the silver balls and indestructible.  There are two
wooden barrels followed by a metal ball, and this repeats itself
indefinitely. Hit the first wooden barrel, and use the ladder up to the
next level as a means to dodge the second barrel and the metal ball.  When
you get to the floor where the barrels are dropping down, run to the left
and flip the switch. Climb the ladder to the top floor, and punch the
chests to the right for health, except be forewarned that the very last
chest contains a green guy who shoots arrows, and the second to last chest
can be stood on to avoid the arrows. Kill the green guy by punching the
chest before getting the last bit of health. Run to the right, avoid axes
and flying dragons. Pick up the wrench. Climb down the first ladder you
come to. As you run to the right, watch for green dudes in the floor which
throw knives at you. To avoid getting hit by the axes that come down, stand
right underneath whence they come, and they'll fly over you from each side.
After defeating the three big green mouths, run and jump across the gap.
You need to jump at the last second to make it. Punch the little head in
the wall three times, and jump onto the chandelier as it lowers. Wait for
the spider to go up to run underneath it. More axes. Some spiders need to
be punched once or twice before they'll go up. After climbing down the
ladders, you'll be back near the entrance. Go right. You might want to
consider using some of your remaining shots from the blue ball to kill the
red bouncy blobs and the bats after them. The gates here will only be open
if you've flipped both switches prior to getting here. Climb down the
ladder; don't go all the way to the left. Some health is on the right then.
Go left, wait for the metal ball to pass, go left, climb the ladder, climb
into the pit, and duck. Wait for the ball, go left, and climb down the
ladder. Pick up the spare bullets, and climb down the next ladder. Run to
the right until you see the gargoyles; then run back to the left, and punch
the button on the wall. There's another green guy in the floor after the
axes. Use the wrench to get past the electric field. Climb up the ladder,
go to the left, and flip the switch. Arm yourself with the gun, climb down
the other ladder, and go to the right. Get in close, and just shoot.  And
keep shooting.  You shouldn't need to refill the gun. Use the blue key to
unlock the door. You are now outside.

     Outside the castle. Go right. Punch the tombstones for health. In the
second set of tombstones, the second tombstone contains a ghost instead of
health. Kill everything. To kill the final guy, watch his shot pattern. Get
in close and jump and kick the face in the middle of his body.
Congratulations, you won.

Adventure 6: ARCADE
012D7C  016E39  016938  00EAA5  002A64


INVINCIBILITY:
 
At the title screen with the Slime World logo that falls with a crash, 
do the following:
     
     1) Press and hold Option 2
     2) Press and hold Option 1 while holding Option 2 down
     3) Move the joypad to the upper right, while holding down both Options
  
After that, release your fingers, and if desired, turn the music back on. 
There is no indicator of your success, until you start playing.  Things 
behave very strangely in multiplayer mode tho, so be warned!


Hidden Passageways:

When you reach the first exit of what appears to be the end of the 
Adventure 6: Arcade,  shoot your gun into the upper right hand corner 
of the wall. A part of the wall will disappear revealing the secret 
passage way.  If you can't continue on,  then try shooting at the wall 
some more.  

When ever you find an exit in this level don't be fooled, it isn't the 
end of the game. There is always (except for the last exit #6) another 
hidden passage to the right of it!  When you are in this secret area of 
the game you find a message (only readable from the map screen) alluding 
to the zip popping contest. 


Zit Popping Contest

A 'Zit Popping' game can be played by going to the summary screens and 
then going to the screen where Todd is pictured green. Press Option 1 and 
you'll see a zit. Blow it up by hitting the buttons as fast as you can. 
This also works in multi-player mode where it becomes a competition against 
your opponent.

Playing tips:

	You can jump out of sticky slime by jumping and pressing shoot at
the same time.  (I believe Wade discovered this, and it made starting out
in combat a lot different)

	You can climb up slippery walls by timing jumps perfectly so that
you jump at the instant you touch the wall.  Pressing the button as fast as
you can works to a lesser extent.(I don't remember but I'll give this one
to Wade as well)

	If you make two megabombs explode in different rooms at the same time
you can create a constantly lit mega-bomb room which will stay lit until
some poor fool walks into it.  (You can also do this using a jet pack but
it becomes somewhat more difficult.  I think the easiest place to do this
is probably in J-room in level five combat.  I think we all discovered this
one together.)

	Somewhere near the end of level 5 logic, there is a wall that you can
walk into, and all the lights from the room around you will go out.  It's
not that great of a trick but I remember having fun with it.

	It's possible to jump into almost any vertical wall and hide by
moving as close to the wall as possible without grabbing on to it, and then
jumping towards the wall pressing jump and shoot at the same time.  It 
takes a lot of practice but the rewards are great.  It is deliciously fun
to hide in a wall where no one can see you, and then open fire on the first 
poor soul to walk in front of you.  The place where it comes in handy is
at the bottom left of the combat maze (right next to J-room)  Sometimes 
you get stuck in that room when someone before you took both jet packs.  
Usually you would have to pop, but if you jump through the wall on the right,
you can set up for a good position for a sneak attack.  
BE VERY CAREFUL though, if you don't jump and press towards the wall at the
exact same time, it is possible to become forever imbedded in the wall.  
In combat with five lives left this can really suck.  Just remember jump,
shoot, and towards the wall all at the same time.  (I think Ryan discovered
this)

	After you get the above technique down, try going to the lower right
corner of combat (that big curved dead end next to the big room) if you 
jump into the wall on the right, you can jump right through and end up in 
level 5 logic.  We suspected that all the mazes might somehow be connected
but never took the time to find out.

[STU]=====================================================================
			      S.T.U.N. RUNNER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Start out at level 11 (Labyrinth) and complete it. On level 12
(Coathanger) go right and catch the boost and continue going right. You
will fly up and then continue and cross the finish line. You will be warped
to level 18!

[SUP]=====================================================================
			       SUPER SKWEEK
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Choose Normal Game from the options. At the map screen position Skweek
(or Skruch) over the "O" in the word GARGOUIL LAND and scale until you
can't fly any lower. You will see a snorkeling furball. It may take some
positioning, but maneuver yourself over the furball and then press OPT 1 so
you can go to the forbidden islands. If you want two extra men, scale onto
the small island directly to the right of the WELCOME ISLAND in the upper
right corner of the dark blue spot. You will see a Skweek next to a palm
tree. Hover over it and push OPT 1 for two extra lives. To gain 3000 extra
coins, scale over to the large body of water in the PAGALAGOS ISLAND. You
will see a Skweek. Hover over it, push OPT 1 and the cash is yours. (from
July 1992 EGM)


[SWI]=====================================================================
			      SWITCHBLADE II
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Every cheat that you'll ever need:  

At the Switchblade II title screen, quickly rotate the directional pad in a 
clockwise motion starting with the Up position.  If you go around several 
times, you'll see a white flash in the background.  After the first flash, 
press Up repeatedly until the flashing stops; you should see a total of four 
flashes.

The first flash activates a stage-skip option, which you can use at any time
during the game:  Just press Pause, then hit B to warp to the beginning of
the next stage.  The second flash gives you infinite energy, the third flash
grants unlimited ammo and the fourth flash gives you unlimited credits in
the weapon shops!               (Video Games magazine)


[TOK]=====================================================================
				   TOKI
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Freak out mode:

     Press and hold down OPT1 and UP before the title screen appears get
into "freak out" mode. Or at the "Continue?" screen, after the first
"beep" of the countdown, and while the timer still shows a 9, press UP and
OPTION 1 at the same time, and hold them. You'll see the GAME OVER screen, 
but keep holding them.  The TOKI demo will appear... keep holding UP and 
on OPTION 1.  After the names of the designers fall down, the demo should
go psychedelic!!  The demo will cycle through colours, a catchy tune will
begin, and the pad will allow you to sample digitized TOKI sounds...
furthermore, pressing DOWN and LEFT repeatedly will cause the samples to 
descend in pitch.  Conversely, pressing UP and RIGHT repeatedly will cause 
the samples to ascend in pitch. Note: Once the new demo begins, release UP 
& OPTION 1.  Then use pad to sample sounds. Pressing A or B starts the game 
normally (from Star*Lynx BBS and Jason).


The digitized designers:

    As the screen fades to black to go to the "continue" screen, hold down 
Option 1 and push UP on the joypad simultaneously.  Hold these all the way 
through the "continue" countdown. After the "continue" timer expires, you'll 
see a white dot in the center of the screen.

At this point, start pressing buttons A and B as quickly as possible (I
noticed presswing the joypad directions will do it too) to make the dot grow.
You'll notice, as the dot grows, that this is a picture of four programmers
(in b&w).  Keep making it grow until it's full screen - the picture briefly turns brown and you get the "game over" screen.


[TOU]=====================================================================
			   TOURNAMENT CYBERBALL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

     In Tournament Cyberball there is an apparent bug in the game that can
be a real cheat.  This works well against another human player.  I haven't
tried it against the computer.  I'm guessing the computer is "too smart" to
fall for this cheat.  Anyways, if you're fairly far up the field, you can
run your quarterback all the way to the opposite end of the field, before
throwing your pass. "Unrealistic" passes can be completed from the opposite
end of the field. Watch out though, some computerized cyberbots will follow
you all the way.

     The advantage of this cheat is simple: It takes out a few of the
computerized defenders, and it throws the defense player off by not
allowing the defense player to see where your receivers are going. In other
words, all you see on both player's lynx's is a pretty much blank screen
with nothing but a quarterback and a few rushers....With enough practice,
one can have little trouble blindly throwing passes like this.

     Lastly, don't try this cheat on the "Real" arcade version of this
game.  It doesn't work.  Actually it's quite amusing what happens.  When
you think the quarterback is going to throw a 70 + yard pass, he/she/it
ends up throwing a pass that lands like 1 yard right in front of the QB.
Try it if you're ahead sometime on the arcade version.  Is kinda
amusing....;-)

[WAR]=====================================================================
				 WARBIRDS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tip for new players.

When playing alone, pause the game and you can still look around with the 
B' button. This may help new pilots so they can pause the action, look 
around and plan their route.


To kill the Red Baron:

First select unlimited damage, 200 rounds of ammo, no collisions, unlimited 
men if you're not good at landing, and a dueling start. Once you're in the 
air, fire your machine guns at the Baron. After he flies by, waste your 
ammunition on purpose. Next, land. While your men are trying to fix your 
plane, the Baron will crash trying to shoot you on the ground.


Single player grave sight.

For single-player Grave Sight, as soon as you die (when the roses and skulls 
border appears) quickly pause the game. 'A' button will change the viewpoint 
from plane to plane (And to the point where you died). Look around with the 
joypad.


[XEN]=====================================================================
				 XENOPHOBE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hints:
     First the basics.  I love the yellow electro gun, so all my strategy
revolves around this gun.  The puffer gun does more damage.
I usually crawl along the ground and fire alot.  I stand to kill festers
and ceiling vines.  Jump to move quickly.

Festers  (the fellows who appear on the sides of the screen) Take these
guys out by being just over half a screen away from them.  Fire like crazy.
You better make sure you are at least half a screen away because these
really hurt!  You can advance on them once they retreat and expose their
hand, makes killing them easier if you do.  When they throw stuff, you
better be facing them and firing... Getting hit by this stuff stuns you,
likely costing your life on later levels.  You can kill them with the
puffer gun by laying low near the edge of the screen, and standing up and
firing as soon as they start to retreat.  You can always ignore these guys
buy crawling along the floor... but it's good to take them out as soon as
you can.  They produce other aliens, and create another hazard. You can
often kill festers on the adjacent screen by firing very close to the edge.
I used this to my advantage alot on level 22, which is almost nothing but
festers.

Ceiling vines:  As I mentioned earlier, make sure you don't move into them
while firing. Stop, then aim up and fire.

Rollerbies (the armadillo like things that curl into a ball) Getting hit by
these balled up creatures can stun you for some time, like the festers can,
which means losing your life in later levels. Fire alot at them to make
them roll the other way of course.  Don't fire too much if there is a
closed door in the way, as they'll bounce  back at you at high speed. They
unravel once they stop moving. I often fire once or twice at them to make
them stop.  They then unravel and I kill them.  Or, I throw a grenade, and
fire just enough to make them be near the grenade.  These guys are what
really threatens your life at the beginning of later levels...  Don't
underestimate what a mob of these can do to your game.  :)  One stuns you,
then every alien and their   brother beat up on you while you can't do
anything.  Then you lose your gun, and losing your gun on later levels
usually means the end of your life, if not your whole game!  (you usually
get a laser with your new  guy, which often is inadaquate).  Point blank
shots often don't work on these guys for some reason, very important to
remember.

Laser firing security drones:  Of course you can make these stop firing at
you by getting the disk and putting it in the security machine. But did you
know that you can kill them?  You have to fire alot, unless you have a
puffer gun.  Stand and fire diagonally up, fire like crazy, and don't
change directions!  They'll move right into your fire.  The laser gun does
so little damage, it is questionable if you should do this with that gun.
I kill these drones on every floor I encounter them until I find the disk.
Little crawling aliens: crawl and fire alot, jump if you they stick to you.
On later levels, it often isn't wise to jump immediately... you might jump
into a festers xray beam, and get stunned, lose your gun, your life, your
game...

Snotterpillars (big hopping spitting aliens):  While heading towards a new
screen, if you hear that you are hitting something just before you enter
the new screen, stop and keep firing until the sound stops.  Then fire a
lot as you enter the new screen.  Firing at them usually stops the nasty
spittle they throw.  You should have no problems taking out mobs of these
fellows by firing alot.  Stop moving as soon you are hitting one, you want
to hit them as far away as you can.  I am pretty brave with these guys,
I'll take on a big mob of them at once.  Just fire very very fast.  If too
many get close, or are about to, move directly away and hit jump twice (or
more) in a row.  This one tactic is the main reason why I survive so long!
Not only does it make you run away quickly, it also has the effect of
dodging their spittle.  Practice turning around and hopping away repeatly
when there aren't aliens around.  Make sure you are moving away before
jumping, otherwise you'll jump up instead of away, and then you're really
If you have the puffer gun, have no fear-- if you fire fast enough, you can
kill a solid wall of these guys with it.
machine that spits out bombs:  Each bomb does 200 damage I think, so be
careful.  Jump away or over bombs that get thrown near you.  hit option two
to fix the machine, then hit option one until you have a full load of
grenades.

self destructing:  often a good idea, unless you are about to finish the
level.  You won't get 200 bonus health, but on later levels you'll probably
lose more than that.  I usually self destruct 2 or maybe 3 levels.

Fire levels:  I am continually switching from the fire extinguisher to the
electro gun on this level.  Put out the fire, run and grab your gun and
clear the rooms until you hit the next fire, etc.  You can push along both
guns, but it's risky.  Fires count as part of the alien remaining count...
so don't leave the fires for last!  Otherwise you'll get stuck with a fire
extinguisher on your next level.  If I'm cautious, I often gain more health
than I lose on these levels.

level 21:  This level is utter hell.  Makes every other level look silly.
Be paranoid with every room you enter.  I can't stress enough how hard this
level is.  Fire as fast as you can.  Good luck keeping your gun...  that's
the main thing actually on the later levels, keeping your gun.  The
beginning of 21 and other later levels is hellish, this is one place where
I wouldn't feel guilty using alot of grenades.  Those hordes of rollerbies
are a real problem at the beginning of levels.

level 22:  This level is as easy as 21 is hard. Almost nothing but festers.
This level might not be so easy if you don't have an electro-gun.  I always
have one here.

level 23, final level:  Use my technique for killing snotterpillars,
especially hopping away repeatedly when mobs get close.  Grenades here can
take a wall of snotterpillers, what a rush. :)   Keep up a wall of fire to
stop their spittle.  Be wary of hidden ceiling vines on the edges of the
screen.  Fire as fast as you can when you see the mother alien, crawl
behind her while firing when you've cleared the other aliens in the room.
Fire at her head once you're behind her. (diagonally up from ground)
It's important to learn to survive with a laser gun until you can get
something better.  Be very convervative, do most of your killing from the
adjacent screen.  Hit things as far away as possible.  Run from
snotterpillars when they get inside your max range (yup, hop twice again..)
use grenades if you have to.  God I hate losing your gun on the later
levels. Free free to mail me any questions and comments.  Is the arcade
game exactly the same?

Strategy:  One of the best things to remember is that you have a limited
supply of money which is sometimes the difference between life and death.
The best item to buy in the shop is "Slow Energy Loss."  This item reduces
the rate at which your energy drains.  At 4x, your energy drains four times
slower than normal.  Keep the Slow Energy Loss at four all of the time.
Buying 125% energy for five coins is not worth the value of buying two and
a half Slow Energy Losses.  If you keep your energy ticking down slowly, you
do not need to carry so much energy.  Buy only the things you need, not just
the things which are nice to have!  This will get you through the game and 
allow you to survive.           (Grey Matter)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

     ZARLOR MERCENARY / The Game of Life

     ACCESSING LIFE:    The game of LIFE is accessed through the character
selection screen of Zarlor Mercenary.  Turn on your Lynx with the Zarlor
Mercenary game card inserted.  Press the fire button twice to get to the
character selection screen.  At this point you must hold down OPTION 1
while moving the joypad as follows: Up, Down, Left, Right, Up.

     At this point your screen should say LIFE and there will be a LIFEform
known as a 'glider' moving across the screen diagonally.  It will go off
the edge of the screen and return on the bottom, eventually running into
the cells forming the word LIFE and causing the chain reaction that
destroys the title screen.

     Before the title screen is destroyed you may try the following
controls:

1.  Moving the joypad or pressing either OPTION button or PAUSE will stop
   the current evolution of LIFE.

2.  Pressing OPTION 1 to continue the evolution puts LIFE into a mode
   where cells that reach the edge of the screen wrap around to the other
   side.

3.  Pressing OPTION 2 to continue the evolution puts LIFE into a mode
   where cells that reach the edge of the screen behave as though they
   have reached a solid wall.  This may be useful if 'gliders' that are
   launched are disrupting your LIFEforms.

4.  Pressing either BUTTON A or BUTTON B puts LIFE into DRAWING MODE.

     DRAWING MODE:  Access DRAWING MODE by pressing BUTTON A or BUTTON B
while LIFE is evolving or after the current LIFEform has reached a stable
state.  You can tell you are in DRAWING MODE because the joypad will be in
control of your cursor, a set of green crosshairs.  While in DRAWING MODE,
your controls behave as follows:

1.  Moving the joypad with BUTTON A depressed will allow you to draw.

2.  Moving the joypad with BUTTON B depressed will allow you to erase.

3.  Pressing OPTION 1 or OPTION 2 will allow your LIFEform to evolve, as
   described in 2 and 3 in the above ACCESSING LIFE section.

4.  Note that the screen cannot be flipped, but attempting to RESTART the
   game will cause the screen to be cleared, and you will remain in the
   DRAWING MODE.

5.  Pressing PAUSE and BUTTON A will put you in COPY MODE.

6.  Pressing PAUSE and BUTTON B will put you in PASTE/ERASE MODE.

7.  Pressing OPTION 2 and PAUSE will copy your current screen to a
   temporary buffer (see below).

     COPY MODE:  Access COPY MODE by holding down PAUSE and pressing BUTTON
A while in DRAWING MODE.  You can tell you are in COPY MODE because the
green crosshairs will be onscreen with the word COPY in green below and
slightly to the right of the crosshairs.  While in COPY MODE, your controls
behave as follows:

1.  Pressing either OPTION 1 or 2 will return you to drawing mode.

2.  Holding down PAUSE and pressing either OPTION 1 or OPTION 2 will
   evolve your LIFEform frame-by-frame.  Note that the OPTION button used
   determines whether screen wrap is on or off.

3.  Pressing BUTTON A sets one corner coordinate of a box that you can
   draw.  Pressing BUTTON A again sets the other corner coordinate of the
   box.  Anything within the box is now in your COPY BUFFER.  You are now
   in PASTE/ERASE MODE.

4.  Holding down PAUSE and pressing BUTTON A takes you to the LIFEform
   library, a screen full of goodies for you to put into your COPY BUFFER.
   After selecting a LIFEform or group of LIFEforms, you will be in
   PASTE/ERASE MODE.

5.  In the LIFEform library, pressing PAUSE and BUTTON A again takes you
   to your temporary buffer (see above). You can cut items from this
   buffer to the main screen.

6.  Holding down PAUSE and pressing BUTTON B takes you directly to
   PASTE/ERASE MODE, using whatever was last put in your COPY BUFFER. If
   you haven't yet selected anything, you may get garbage.

     PASTE/ERASE MODE:  Access PASTE/ERASE MODE either by holding PAUSE and
pressing BUTTON B while in DRAWING MODE, or by going to COPY MODE and
selecting LIFEforms from your screen or the library screen.  You can tell
you are in PASTE/ERASE MODE because your joypad now controls whatever you
have in your COPY BUFFER.  While in PASTE/ERASE MODE, your controls behave
as follows:

1.  Pressing either OPTION 1 or OPTION 2 will return you to DRAWING MODE.

2.  Pressing BUTTON A will allow you to paste your COPY BUFFER.

3.  Pressing BUTTON B will allow you to erase using your COPY BUFFER.

4.  Holding PAUSE and pressing BUTTON B will flip your COPY BUFFER any one
   of eight possible ways.

5.  Note that the screen cannot be flipped, but attempting to RESTART the
   game will cause the screen to be cleared, and you will remain in the
   PASTE/ERASE MODE.

6.  Pressing PAUSE and BUTTON A will put you in COPY MODE.


Full Power-Ups:  

To get a fully powered up ship try the following trick:  At the beginning of 
the game select XQ49.  On the third level, second boss, let him kill you once 
and then finish the level.  At the shop buy one of these items: power shot, 
side shooters, back shooters, auto fire, super sheilds, or lasers.  You'll 
have everything maxed out except mega bombs and lives, but you can use the 
rest of your Zarbits on 'em.    (GamePro)
